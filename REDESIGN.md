Let's redesign the web app inspired by Russian Constructivism design patterns.
We have extensible configuration files, including for theme, let's use them as much as possible and extend them if necessary. Maybe we can wrap our existing theme config to further abstract the style, such as calling the existing one "original plain" and this one "constructivism".

DESIGN SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS:

TYPOGRAPHY:

- Headers: Bebas Neue (bold, uppercase, tracking: 0.15em)
- Subheaders: Work Sans (semibold, normal case)
- Body: Work Sans (regular)
- Code/Tech: IBM Plex Mono

COLOR PALETTE: (Warm Modernist)

- Primary: #8B0000 (dark red)
- Secondary: #D4A574 (warm tan)
- Accent: #2C5F2D (forest green)
- Background: #FAF7F2 (warm off-white)
- Text: #1A1A1A (near-black)

BORDER RADIUS: (4px subtle rounds)

- Buttons, cards, containers: 4px
- Small elements: 2px

BUTTON TREATMENT: (Outlined)

- Border: 2px solid
- Hover: Filled with color
- Focus: Border thickens to 3px

GRID LAYOUT: (Asymmetric Constructivist)

- Diagonal divisions
- Overlapping elements
- Dynamic composition
- Breaking out of standard grid

GEOMETRIC ACCENTS: (Integrated Shapes)

- Geometric shapes incorporated into layout structure
- Circles, triangles, rectangles as functional containers
- Colored geometric backgrounds for sections
- Shapes guide eye flow through content

AESTHETIC NOTES:

- Balance bold geometric forms with functional clarity
- Use diagonal lines and asymmetric balance strategically
- Incorporate Constructivist principles: form follows function, dynamic composition
- Modern interpretation—not a museum piece
- Minimal, less is more
